Toast whole cumin and coriander seeds in a dry pan for about two minutes until fragrant, then grind them. Mix with the other ground spices. For the sauce base, use tomatoes, yogurt, garlic, ginger, and a touch of cream. No nuts needed at all. This way you have full control over every ingredient and can confidently tell Olivia it's safe."
